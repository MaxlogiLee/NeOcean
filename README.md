# NeOcean
NeOcean is a tumor neoantigen analysis platform that integrates proteogenomic strategies to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches relying solely on DNA mutation burden. By incorporating gene fusions, intron retention, chimeric transcripts, and transposable elements, and validating peptides via HLA-pulldown mass spectrometry, NeOcean enables the high-efficiency identification of non-canonical neoantigens, with a detection rate nearly a thousand times higher than conventional methods. It features an optimized RNA-seq analysis pipeline, machine learningâ€“based neoantigen prediction, and high-throughput mass spectrometry validation. Systematic analyses across tumor types reveal distinct sequence features and conserved expression patterns of non-canonical neoantigens. Ongoing functional studies will further evaluate their immunogenic potential, providing a new framework for neoantigen-based cancer immunotherapy.
