# NeOcean
Based on an innovative research strategy integrating proteomics and genomics, we have developed a tumor neoantigen analysis platform named NeOcean, which significantly overcomes the limitations of conventional methods that rely solely on DNA mutation burden. This platform systematically incorporates diverse RNA-derived events, including gene fusions, intron retention, chimeric transcripts, and transposable elements, and combines them with HLA-pulldown mass spectrometry to validate peptide presentation. As a result, NeOcean has successfully identified a large number of previously unrecognized non-canonical neoantigens, achieving a detection efficiency nearly a thousand times higher than traditional approaches.At the technical level, we optimized the bioinformatic pipeline for RNA-seq data analysis, developed dedicated machine learning algorithms for neoantigen prediction, and established a high-throughput mass spectrometry validation strategy based on multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Through systematic analyses across various tumor types, we found that non-canonical neoantigens possess unique sequence characteristics and expression patterns, and exhibit a high degree of conservation across different patient cohorts.In subsequent studies, we will perform both in vitro and in vivo functional validations—including T cell activation assays, cytokine secretion profiling, and tumor organoid experiments—to comprehensively assess the immunogenic potential of these non-canonical neoantigens. This research not only expands our understanding of tumor immunogenicity but also provides crucial theoretical support for the clinical translation of non-canonical neoantigen vaccines, paving a new path for cancer immunotherapy.
